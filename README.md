This project contains files for Cisco Packet Tracer and web hosting exercises.

Note: The images are not organized into separate folders. Originally, the code was created with organized folders, but Cisco Packet Tracer does not support folder structures for uploaded files. In typical code, images in another folder would be called using a path like foldername/image.png. If the image is in the same folder as the main file (e.g., index.html), it can be called directly like image.png. To make everything work correctly in Cisco Packet Tracer, all images had to be placed in a single folder.
